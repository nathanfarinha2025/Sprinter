        <h2>Training for Sprinting</h2>
        <p>Sprinting is all about explosive power and speed. To train effectively, athletes must focus on building strength in their legs and core while improving their reaction time. Training involves short bursts of intense activity, typically in 60 to 100 meters, followed by rest periods. Sprints should be repeated in intervals to maximize performance.</p>
        <p>Drills such as high knees, butt kicks, and plyometrics help in improving an athlete's agility. Additionally, incorporating weightlifting and resistance training ensures that the muscles used during sprinting are strong and conditioned for peak performance. Consistency is key when preparing for competitions.</p>

        <h2>Competitive Sprinting</h2>
        <p>In competitive sprinting, races are typically run over distances of 100 meters, 200 meters, and 400 meters. These events require not only speed but also precision in technique, such as starting block performance, running posture, and stride length. Athletes spend a great deal of time perfecting their start, as even a fraction of a second lost can be the difference between winning and losing.</p>
        <p>Mindset is just as important as physical conditioning in sprinting. Athletes need to stay focused, maintain calm under pressure, and give 100% effort from start to finish. Sprinting is not only a test of speed but also of mental endurance and the ability to execute a race strategy flawlessly.</p>
